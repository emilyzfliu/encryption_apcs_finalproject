# encryption_apcs_finalproject
A thing I did for my final project in AP CS. Consists of ciphers and a GUI.

A cipher is classified as any set algorithm that encrypts plaintext into ciphertext.
This project consists of programs that simulate the behavior of various ciphers
that are put into a GUI.

I first started this project quite a while ago, when I decided to code a Caesar Cipher
algorithm for fun. For my final project in AP Computer Science, I decided to expand on
that idea and simulate the algorithms for other ciphers.

Currently, my project consists mainly of classically encrypted ciphers, but I hope to include
more modern encryption and cryptoanalysis techniques in the future.
